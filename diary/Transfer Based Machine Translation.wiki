== Transfer Based Machine Translation ==
    → Refers to encoding and then decoding information.
    Translation Requires 
        * Creativity
        * Common Sense
        * World Knowledge
    As the languages become more formal their translation becomes a lot easier.
    Basic steps involved are
        1) Analysis of source language(Generation of TAM Markers and shallow parsing)
        2) Transfer from SL to Target Language(The transfer is based on lexical substitution)
        3) Generation of the target language from the structure produced in step 2.
    Vaquous Triangle
        This triangle describes the MT process the ends are SL → IL , IL → TL,SL →  TL.
        In this triangle as we move up towards IL we have to do more work in analysis.
        We can choose to transfer at any stage.
        
        The number of models required for indermediate stage if we have n source and m target languages is 
            = (m + n*m + n).
    Universal Networking Language(UNL) - This is required for making a unified representation of interlingua which can help to transfer in any language.
    === LSMT(Linguistic Structure Based Machine Translation) ===
        This is important for low resource languages
        The pipe line consists of following-
        1) Segmentation
        2) POS Tagging
        3) Morph Analyzer
        4) Chunker
        5) Transfer 
        6) NER 
        7) Transliteration
        8) WSD(Word Sense Disambiguation)
        9) Lexical Substitution
        10) Morph Generation
        While using shallow parsing in the transfer stage we dont have trees so we have to move chunks of objects to get the desired word order.
        For this we need to know the rules like in English we have SVO and in Hindi we have SOV.Create movements according to these rules.
        WSD(Word Sense Disambiguation) is stuck due to need of world knowledge.
        *Modules in LSMT System*
        1) One module per layer
        2) The output of one serves as input of the other.
        3) A pipeline is created.
        4) A unified representation is needed for the modules.
